# ply

A language library built with [cursiv](https://github.com/ydaveluy/cursiv).

## Build

Requires CMake 3.30+, Git and a C++20 compiler with `std::format` and `musttail`
support. Cursiv's CI uses GCC 16 and Clang 22.

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The build generates the parser automatically. Rebuild after changing the grammar.

## What to edit

| What you want to change | File |
|---|---|
| The grammar | `src/ply/core/PlyGrammar.hpp` |
| The AST | `src/ply/core/ast.hpp` |
| Validation checks | `src/ply/core/validation/` |
| Services of your own | `src/ply/core/CoreServices.hpp` + `CoreModule.cpp` |
| The command line | `src/ply/cli/main.cpp` |
| LSP features | `src/ply/lsp/LspModule.cpp` |
| Test cases | `tests/grammar_test.cpp` |

Generated files live under `build/src/generated-src/`; do not edit them.

## The sample

```
ply
format ascii 1.0
comment made by Greg Turk
comment this file is a cube
element vertex 8
property float x
property float y
property float z
element face 6
property list uchar int vertex_index
end_header
0 0 0
0 0 1
0 1 1
0 1 0
1 0 0
1 0 1
1 1 1
1 1 0
4 0 1 2 3
4 7 6 5 4
4 0 4 5 1
4 1 5 6 2
4 2 6 7 3
4 3 7 4 0
```

A PLY document is a header -- the elements a file declares (`vertex`,
`face`, ...) and their properties, scalar or list -- followed by one line
per vertex and one per face. `comment` lines are trivia, dropped like
whitespace.

## The command line

```bash
./build/src/ply_cli example/example1.ply
./build/src/ply_cli --dump example/example1.ply   # the syntax tree
```

The exit code is the verdict: 0 clean, 1 the document carries an error, 2 the
command was wrong, 3 something threw.

## The language server

`ply_lsp` speaks LSP over stdio. In VS Code, open this folder and
press **F5**: the task builds the server in the tree of the preset you have
selected. GCC/Clang presets run the host binary; WASI presets run the wasm
module. A second window opens on `example/` with the extension loaded. The preset is
read through the CMake Tools extension, which the workspace recommends along
with clangd. Native servers require VS Code 1.86 or later; WASI servers require
1.101 or later.

```bash
(cd vscode && npm install && npm run compile)
```
